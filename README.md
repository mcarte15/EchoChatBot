# EchoChatBot
Simple ChatBot created via Python
Creating this to help learn Python, I will eventually add more functionality to this chatbot. For now it is set to just Echo or repeat user input.
The final stages of this project will ask the user name, indicate that the bot is a bot and not a human, and ask trouble shooting questions

Codecademy Suggestions:
In creating Echo Chatbot, you’re already implementing some patterns that you’ll use as you develop more complex chatbot programs:

Greeting a user.
Informing the user that they are interacting with a bot (and not a human).
Instructing the user on how to interact with the bot.
Accepting user input.
Setting up output that is dependent on user input.
Want to extend this project further? Try adding more lines of input and output to craft a funny sort of conversation. You can also ask for the user’s name and then use it in subsequent outputs.
